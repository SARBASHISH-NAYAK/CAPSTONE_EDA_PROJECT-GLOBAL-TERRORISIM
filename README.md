# CAPSTONE_EDA_PROJECT-GLOBAL-TERRORISIM

SUMMERY:-

The term "Terrorism" is devided from Latin Word "Terror" , which refers to "Great Fear". The word "Terrorism" was first used during "French Revolution" in the year 1795.
The Global Terrorism Dataset(GTD) summarizes all the terrorist attacks globally from 1970 to 2017.
We have used Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to represent our insights meaningfully and draw conclusions.
Through this project we aim to analyse the following:-

What the hot zones of terrorism? What causes the strained relationship between countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan? How dreadful were the Boko Harams in Nigeria? How safe id Mumbai after 26/11/2008? Study the patterns of Naxalism in the Indian states. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
This global Terrorism dataset has the record of attacks in between 1970 to 2017
describe few of the columns which we have considered for our analysis.
In this Global Terrorisim dataset the column iyear represents the year of attack in between 1970-2017, imonth represents the month of the attack & idate represents the day of the terrorist attacks in world wide.
The column country is the country code of the perticular county and the column country_txt shows the corresponding country name.
The column region shows the region code of the targetted region and the column region_txt shows the corresponding region name.
The column provstate shows the impacted state of the counry, cLetsity shows the list of cities of the state which have under attack by the terrorist.
Then we have the columns latitude and longitude containing data of the geographical coordinates of the attacks. The column vicinity shows the vicinity of the attacks.
The column location shows the location of the attacks or the place where the terrorists attacked , and the column summary briefs the date of the attack, type of the attack , number of terrorists, type of weapons used, targets and the damages.
The column alternative contains data of the no. of alternative attacks of the the day are made in the terrorist attacks , & the column alternative_txt that shows the type of alternatve attacks in the perticular day in which the terrorist are attacked.
The column success has either 0 or 1 showing success or failure of the attack , and the column sucide contains number of terrorist who died if it was a suicide attack.
Then we have the columns attacktype1 , attacktype2 , attacktype3 which show the code of type of the attack .The column attacktype1_txt shows the text corresponding to the attack type(Assassination,Hostage Taking/Kidnapping,Bombing/Explosion..etc.)
The columns targtype1 shows the code for the type of targets, and the column targtype1_txt shows the text correspoding to targtype1.
The column gname shows the name of the terrorist outfit. The column motive is to show the motive behind the attack.
The column individual shows whether the terrorist carried out the attack in a team or a group.
The columns weaptype1 , weaptype2 ,weaptype3 , weapsubtype1 , weaptype2 , weaptype3 are for the weapon types used in the terrorist attacks, and the columns weaptype1_txt , weaptype2_txt , weaptype3_txt , weapsubtype1_txt , weapsubtype2_txt , weapsubtype3_txt are for the corresponding name of the weapon used (Gasoline or Alcohol,Explosives,Incendiary,Pipe Bombetc.) The column weapdetail provides additional details of the weapon used
The columns ransom,ransompaid contain the randsome amount demand(if any) and how much the authorith have paid(if any).
We as a team believe that meaningful dialogues,inclusive state policies,addressing problems at the root cause can protect us all from the cowardly and ghastly practice of terror mongering called TERRORISM. We as future data scientists and analysts have tried to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these unhumanly acts...

 Business Objective:-
 
Thousands of researchers, analysts, policy-makers, and students use the Global Terrorism Database(GTD) every day. We aim to better understand the strengths and limitations of the present security agents through an intensive study of this database. The objective is to analyse the causes and consequences of terrorism through a detailed analysis of the GTD.
The unfortunate reality is that terrorism has gone global and every world citizen is equally susceptible and vulnerable. To reduce terrorist attacks we have to teach children to continue their education at the primary school education level and increase the defence strength in border line which sites are more vulnerable.

In order to achieve business objective, We would suggest the following based on my observation and analysis:-

Identification of unknown terror groups
Promoting scientific education for religious extremists
Addressing issues of resilient forces before they become larger terror groups
Keeping a strict vigilance of movement of raw materials used for manufacture of explosives
More deployment of armed forces in Northern parts of India
The Middle East and North Africa regions are the most targeted so the Govt. of that region should increase their defence and investigation departments.

CONCLUSION:-

This project uses historical data of terrorist attacks that took place around the world in between 1970 to 2017, and contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks.
In this project we saw that which countries are least affected and which countries are most affected by the terrorist attacks. And Taliban group were the most attackers in the history of terrorist attacks. In this project we analysed how they plan and attack countries and who they target.The primary target of terrorists are civilians and private property amounting to approximate 25% of military, police, and Government officials are in risk.

Additional findings:-

Iraq has the most attacks.
The Middle East and North Africa Regions has most taregeted.
Maximum number of attacks are from Bombing/Explosions.
There are maximum number of attacks in Private citizens and Property.
Taliban and ISIL has a most active organisation.
It is evident form the trend analysis that since 1971 there has been significant increase in terror attacks globally. Terrorist Groups like ISIL, taliban, Al-Shabaab , BOko Haram, NPA, assassination, etc. However, in recent times there has been slight decrease in terrorist attacks.
We need to understand that every human live is precious and we should take all efforts to curb terrorism and sponsors of terrorism.
Development of both socio econimic and educational are the only permanent solution to this problem.
